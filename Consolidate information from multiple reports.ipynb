According to Report 1 and Report 3, this occurred amidst a broader anti-corruption drive within China to reform state-owned enterprises, with the company confirming normal operations despite the investigation. Additionally, CCDI announced an investigation into Wang for \"serious law and discipline violations\" and he was suspected of nepotism and profiteering for relatives through Sinopec dealings (Report 2, Report 3). Report 4 and Report 5 reveal that following his removal from his party roles and subsequent detention, Wang Tianpu faced charges of corruption and bribery, ultimately being sentenced to 15 years and six months in prison, along with a fine and the confiscation of illicit gains, to which he pleaded guilty without appeal (Report 5). This reflects China\\'s rigorous campaign against corruption within its energy sector, highlighted by the probes into Sinopec and another oil giant, China National Petroleum Corp (Report 3).', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)\n"
